            Agile values are outlined by the Agile Alliance in The Agile
            Manifesto. This set of values encourages putting people before
            processes, getting software out the door fast, collaborating with
            customers, and adjusting plans as needed.

            1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools. <br />
            2. Working software over comprehensive documentation.<br />3.
            Customer collaboration over contract negotiation. <br />4.
            Responding to change over following a plan.

        <div class="card-body">
          <h6 class="card-title">
            In, 2001, the Agile Manifesto surfaced. The 12 principles serves as
            the guide to speed up the development time and to produce a quality
            product.
          </h6>
          <p class="card-text">
            1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and
            continuous delivery of valuable software. <br />2. Welcome changing
            requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness
            change for the customer’s competitive advantage. <br />3. Deliver
            working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of
            months, with a preference to the shorter timescale. <br />4.
            Business people and developers must work together daily throughout
            the project. <br />5. Build projects around motivated individuals.
            Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to
            get the job done. <br />6. The most efficient and effective method
            of conveying information to and within a development team is
            face-to-face conversation. <br />7. Working software is the primary
            measure of progress. <br />8. Agile processes promote sustainable
            development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to
            maintain a constant pace indefinitely. <br />9. Continuous attention
            to technical excellence and good design enhances agility. <br />10.
            Simplicity — the art of maximizing the amount of work not done — is
            essential. <br />11. The best architectures, requirements, and
            designs emerge from self-organizing teams. <br />12. At regular
            intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then
            tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

Our team learned that the Agile Manifesto's 4 values the development process and focuses on quality by creating products that meet consumers' needs and expectations. The 12 principles' purpose is to support a work environment that is focused on the customer, that aligns to business objectives and that can respond and adjust quickly as user needs and market changes.
